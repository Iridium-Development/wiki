Skyblock is an unofficial game mode for Minecraft that was established in 2011. It was originally a challenge map that contained a single tree, a chest with supplies, and a small cube of dirt, and the player was expected to survive using the resources they had and their knowledge of the game.

Now, Skyblock is one of the most popular game modes (following Survival and Creative), spawning thousands of different varieties and twists to pull in new players and sell the idea of a challenge that can be enjoyed with friends.

IridiumSkyblock aims to deliver this image with excellence, streamlining the setup process and eliminating the headache of having to figure out the details, while also proving to be extremely configurable to create an unparalleled experience.
